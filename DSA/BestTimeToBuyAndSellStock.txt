Problem Statement

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on day i.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve.
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

You must buy before you sell.

Input Format
n
p0 p1 p2 ... p(n-1)


First line: integer n → number of days

Second line: n space-separated integers → prices[i] for day i

Output Format

Output a single integer: the maximum profit.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 200000
0 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9


Time complexity should be O(n).
Brute force O(n²) will likely not pass all test cases.

Sample Input 0
6
7 1 5 3 6 4

Sample Output 0
5

Explanation

Buy on day 1 at price = 1

Sell on day 4 at price = 6

Profit = 6 - 1 = 5

You cannot do better than this.
