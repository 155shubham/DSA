Word Break is a classic DP problem and a great one for interviews. I’ll give you a clean HackerRank-style prompt, constraints, examples, the DP idea (bottom-up + optimization), common pitfalls, and then you can write the C# solution. Ready? Here we go.

🚀 Problem: Word Break (DP)
Problem statement

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. Otherwise return false.

You may reuse dictionary words any number of times.

Function signature (C#)
public bool WordBreak(string s, IList<string> wordDict)

Input format (conceptual)

s — a non-empty string (only lowercase letters for simplicity)

wordDict — list/collection of unique words

Output

Return true if s can be segmented into one or more dictionary words; otherwise false.

Examples

Example 1

s = "leetcode"
wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: "leetcode" = "leet" + "code"


Example 2

s = "applepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: "applepenapple" = "apple" + "pen" + "apple"


Example 3

s = "catsandog"
wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
