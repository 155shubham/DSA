Problem: Pair with Given Sum
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there are any two distinct elements in the array that add up to the target sum. Return true if such a pair exists, otherwise return false.

Example 1:
Input: arr = , target = 17

Output: true

Explanation: 10 + 7 = 17.

Example 2:
Input: arr = , target = 8

Output: false

Explanation: No two numbers add up to 8.

Constraints:
The array may contain both positive and negative integers.

Each input will have at least two elements.

Task:
Write a function or program that takes the list of numbers and the target sum as input and returns true or false according to the criteria above.
