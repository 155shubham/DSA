Problem 7: Jump Game (Greedy)

This is a HIGH-frequency interview question at Agoda, Booking, Expedia, and companies with optimization-heavy systems.

It tests:

Greedy reasoning

Handling edge cases

Time-optimal thinking

Ability to detect that DP/recursion is unnecessary

Problem Statement

You are given an integer array nums where:

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum jump length from that position.

Your task:

Return true if you can reach the last index, otherwise return false.

You start at index 0.

🖥️ Function Signature
public bool CanJump(int[] nums)
{
    // your logic
}

📌 Examples
Example 1
nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]


You can jump:

from index 0 → (up to 2 steps)

go to index 1 → jump 3 steps

reach last index

Output:

true

Example 2
nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]


Here:

you get stuck at index 3 (value = 0)

cannot reach the end

Output:

false

📌 Constraints
1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^5

🎯 What interviewers want

They want to see that you:

Detect the greedy pattern

DO NOT try DP or BFS first

Track the farthest index reachable so far

Stop early when farthest index < current index

This solution must be O(n).
