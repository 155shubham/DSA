Problem Statement

You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.
Your task is to find the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the given target.

Return the indices as a space-separated pair in increasing order of index.

If no such pair exists, print -1 -1.

You may assume exactly one valid pair exists unless specified otherwise.

Input Format
n
nums[0] nums[1] ... nums[n-1]
target


n → number of elements

Next line → n space-separated integers (the array)

target → the integer sum we need to find

Output Format

Print two integers, the indices of the pair that sums to the target:

i j


(Where i < j)

If no pair exists:

-1 -1

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
-10^9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9
-10^9 ≤ target ≤ 10^9


Time Limit: must run efficiently (O(n) expected).
Brute force O(n²) may not pass all cases.
