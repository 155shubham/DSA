What are the top 10 essential DSA topics for quick practice before my interview

The top 10 essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics for quick practice before your interview are:

Arrays

Key problems: Pair with given sum, Maximum Subarray, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock.

Strings

Important problems: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Check for Anagram, Longest Palindromic Substring.

Linked Lists

Practice reversing a linked list, detecting a cycle, and merging sorted lists.

Stacks & Queues

Key points: Valid Parentheses, Next Greater Element, Implement Queue using Stacks.

Searching & Sorting

Focus on Binary Search and common sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort), and searching in rotated arrays.

Trees (Binary Trees and BSTs)

Important topics: Maximum Depth, Level Order Traversal, Lowest Common Ancestor, Validate BST.

Graphs

Practice DFS, BFS, detecting cycles, Number of Islands, Topological Sorting.

Hashing

Problems like Two Sum, Subarray with sum zero, and frequency counting with hash maps/sets.

Heaps (Priority Queues)

Common problems: Top K Frequent Elements, Find Median from Data Stream.

Dynamic Programming

Essential problems: 0/1 Knapsack, Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Longest Common Subsequence.

These topics cover widely asked coding problems and give you quick, practical practice for interviews. Practicing implementation and understanding both brute force and optimized solutions in these areas will help you prepare effectively in a short time.

If you want curated question sets for practice, platforms like LeetCode’s Top Interview Questions are very helpful for quick review.
